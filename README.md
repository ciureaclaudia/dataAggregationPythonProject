Aggregated Reports
-
Overview
-
In this project, we performed an analysis on the average number of hours an average American sleeps per day in a year, using the dataset "Time Americans Spend Sleeping.csv". We employed the libraries NumPy and Pandas to conduct various data aggregations, grouping by different variables.

Data Handling
-
- We imported the data from the CSV file and stored it in a Pandas DataFrame named df.

- We created new DataFrames by grouping data based on various variables using the groupBy function.

- Various aggregation methods were applied to these grouped DataFrames, such as count, sum, min, max, and mean.

- Sorting operations (ascending order) were performed on the aggregated data using NumPy and Pandas libraries.

- Data was also grouped based on different variables and stored in NumPy arrays and DataFrames.

- We maintained a matrix that encompassed the entire set of observations for comprehensive analysis.

Results
-
The results of these grouping and data operations were saved in CSV files. It's important to note that only the most significant operations were exported to CSV files to avoid cluttering the project with an excessive number of files.

The analysis provides insights into the average sleep duration of an average American over a year, and the aggregation methods, groupings, and operations used are detailed for reference.
